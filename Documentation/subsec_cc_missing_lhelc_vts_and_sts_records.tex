\subsection{CC Lower House election vote records and seat results missing}\label{cc_missing_lhelc_pty_vts_and_sts_records}
Consistency check \texttt{\footnotesize cc\_missing\_lhelc\_pty\_vts\_and\_sts\_records} is based on tables Party, Lower House Seat Results and Lower House Vote Results, and provides information at the level of individual parties nested in lower house elections. 

It enlists all parties individual vote and seat results for any LH election in which for at least one party (incl. categories `Others with seat' and `Independents') neither plurality nor proportional vote result are recorded (i.e., \texttt{\footnotesize Null}-values).


CC \texttt{\footnotesize cc\_missing\_lhelc\_pty\_vts\_and\_sts\_records} is programmed as follow:

{\em \bf Note}: Missing vote records at the party level of lower house elections are consequential for several aggregate figures and indicators, including Gallagher's Least-Square Index of Disproportionality in vote and seat results \ldots
