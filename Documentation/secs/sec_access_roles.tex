There exist three different roles with different sets of privileges to operate in the PCDB via \texttt{\footnotesize pgAdmin3}:
\begin{itemize}
\item[(1)]{{\bf Administrator}: Having all privileges on both the \texttt{\footnotesize public} and the \texttt{\footnotesize config\_data} schemes. 
This role is assumed by account \texttt{\footnotesize polconfdb} and \texttt{\footnotesize polconfdb\_1}. 
Having all privileges includes to \texttt{\footnotesize GRANT} and \texttt{\footnotesize REVOKE} privileges to and from other the user roles.}

\item[(2)]{{\bf Read-and-Write}: Having privileges  \texttt{\footnotesize SELCECT},  \texttt{\footnotesize INSERT}, and  \texttt{\footnotesize UPDATE} on both the \texttt{\footnotesize public} and the \texttt{\footnotesize config\_data} schemes. 
This role is assumed by account \texttt{\footnotesize polconfdb\_2} and \texttt{\footnotesize polconfdb\_3}.
Note that the  \texttt{\footnotesize SELECT}-privilege includes the operation  \texttt{\footnotesize COPY TO}, which allows to extract data from queries to  \texttt{\footnotesize .csv}-documents.}

\item[(3)]{{\bf Read-Only}: Having privilege \texttt{\footnotesize SELCECT} on both the \texttt{\footnotesize public} and the \texttt{\footnotesize config\_data} schemes. 
This role is assumed by account \texttt{\footnotesize polconfdb\_4} and \texttt{\footnotesize polconfdb\_5}.
