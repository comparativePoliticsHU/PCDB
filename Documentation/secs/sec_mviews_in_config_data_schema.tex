\section{Materialized views in the \texttt{config\_data} schema}\label{sec_mviews_in_config_data_schema}

The materialized views contained in the \texttt{config\_data} schema of the PCDB compute are exact copies of the views (see \ref{sec_views_in_config_data_schema}), and are theerfore often homonyms

Generally, in database managment, a view is a virtual table representing the result set of a predefined query on the database.%\footnote{See \url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Materialized_view#Introduction}} 
While a view complies the defined data whenever it is queried, a materialized view caches the result set of the view in a manifest table.
When changes on the data in the tables the view is defined on occur, when queried, the view will be up-to-date.
The materialized view created before these changes occur, however, will still hold the depricated data.
Hence, materialization comes at the cost of being potentially out-of-date.

It is therefore imperative to define trigger structures on base tables and materialized views, in order to maintain the conistency of the data in materialized views.
This aspect of view materilaization will henceforth be highlighted in the subsections of this section.
