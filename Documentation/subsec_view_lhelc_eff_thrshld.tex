\subsection{Lower House Election Effective Thresholds}\label{view_lhelc_eff_thrshld}
View \texttt{\footnotesize view\_lhelc\_eff\_thrshlds} is based on table Lower House Election and provides data at the level of lower house elections.


It computes the effective threshold in a given lower house election.

Variable \texttt{\footnotesize lhelc\_eff\_thrshld\_lijphart1994} computes the threshold according to the definition provided by \citet{Lijphart1994}: 
\begin{equation}\label{EffT_Lijphart_equation}
EffT_{Lijphart}=\frac{0.5}{m+1}+\frac{0.5}{2m} 
\end{equation}, where $m$ is the district magnitude.

Variable \texttt{\footnotesize lhelc\_eff\_thrshld\_taagepera2002}, in contrast, computes the threshold according to the definition provided by \citet[p.\,309]{Taagepera2002}: 
\begin{equation}\label{EffT_Taagepera_equation}
EffT_{Taagepera}=\frac{0.75}{n^{2}+(S/n^{2})}
\end{equation}, where $S$ is the size of the lower house (i.e., the total number of seats), and $n$ is the number of seat winning parties.

In the PCDB it is assumed that $n \approx \sqrt[4]{m*S}$. 
This yields
\begin{equation}\label{EffT_PCDB_equation}
EffT_{PCDB}=\frac{0.75}{(m+1)*\sqrt{S/m}}
\end{equation} to compute variable \texttt{\footnotesize lhelc\_eff\_thrshld\_pcdb}.
, which is in fact identical with Taagepera's formular, if $n = \sqrt[4]{m*S}$.


View \texttt{\footnotesize view\_lhelc\_eff\_thrshlds} is programmed as follows:
