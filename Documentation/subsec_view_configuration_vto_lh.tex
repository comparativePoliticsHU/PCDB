\subsection{Lower House Veto}\label{view_configuration_vto_lh}
View \texttt{\footnotesize view\_configuration\_vto\_lh} is based on table Veto Points, view Cabinet's Seat Share in the Lower House (\ref{view_cab_lh_sts_shr}), and materialized view Configuration Events, and provides information at the level of political configurations.

It computes whether the lower house constitutes an open veto point vis-\`a-vis the government in a given configuration by comparing cabinet's seat share in the temproally corresponding lower house with decisive threshold enlisted in table Veto Points. 

To guarantee that the computation of the lower houses veto potential is sensitive to constitutional changes, joining poltitical configurations with veto inforamtion is proceeded by date and country. 
Computation of the lower house's veto power in a given configuration is therefore up-to-date according to the inforamtion recorded in the Veto Points table.

View \texttt{\footnotesize view\_configuration\_vto\_lh} is programmed as follows:

\lstinputlisting[%caption={Code to determine if the lower house constitutes an open  veto point in a configuration.},
language=SQL]%
{../SQL-codes/view_configuration_vto_lh.sql}



{\bf Note}: 	Substracting the total seat share of cabinet parties in the lower house from the respective veto power threshold of lower houses results in a positive value when the former is smaller than the latter, for instance, in the case of a minority government in a parliamentary system.

To guarantee that the binary variable \texttt{\footnotesize vto\_lh} indicates a closed veto point even when the  government holds a seat share equal to 50 percent in the lower house, and thus equals the veto power threshold (e.g. cab\_lh\_sts\_shr = 50.0), the total seat share of cabinet parties in lower house is increased by an abitrarly small value ($1e^{-5}$) that does not effect the computation substantially.

Apparently, a lower house's veto potential in a given configuration can only be determined where full information on the veto institution's start and end date as well as on the respective veto power threshold exists in table Veto Points.
