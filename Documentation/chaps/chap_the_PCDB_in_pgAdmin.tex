\chapter{The PCDB in \texttt{\bf pgAdmin}}\label{chap_the_PCDB_in_pgAdmin}

The PCDB is mostly easily accessed using the database managment and adminstration software \texttt{pgAdmin}.
You need to install \texttt{pgAdmin} on your computer,\footnote{Refer to \url{https://www.pgadmin.org/download/}} and connect to the PCDB on the server of the Humboldt-University, which is hosted by the Computer and Media Service (CMS).

The next couple of sections will provide a hands-on guide on 
how to connect to the PCDB on the CMS server (see \ref{sec_connecting_to_the_PCDB}),
how to query data from the PCDB (see \ref{sec_query_from_the_PCDB}), and
how to keep data in the PCDB up-to-date (see \ref{sec_keeping_the_PCDB_updated})
using the tools provided by with \texttt{pgAdmin3}.\footnote{When the first Pages of this Documentation were written, \texttt{pgAdmin4} was not available.}
