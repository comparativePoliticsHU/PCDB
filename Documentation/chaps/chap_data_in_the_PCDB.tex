\chapter{Data in the PCDB}\label{chap_data_in_the_PCDB}

This chapter provides a description of the data structre in the PCDB. 

Five entity types will be discussed:
\begin{itemize}
\item[]{{\bf Tables}: 
  The permanent data repositories that store information at different levels of aggregation (e.g., parties, institutions, countries, etc.) and serve as priamry source for all computed indices and aggregate figures.}
\item[]{{\bf Views}: 
  Virtual tables based on the result-sets of predefined SQL-queries.
  Views serve two purposes in the PCDB:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item[a)]Compute aggregates and indices from the primary data contained in tables,
    \item[b)]and create consistency checks that allow to control for the consistency of the data.
  \end{itemize}}
\item[]{{\bf Materialized views}: Tables created from views that may be updated from the original base tables as implemented by triggers and fucntions.}
\item[]{{\bf Triggers}: 
  Implemented on tables or materialized views to insert, update, or delete data as consequence of specific events. 
  Triggers are mainly implemented to enable the automatic up-dating of the data in the PCDB.}
\item[]{{\bf Functions}: The stored procedures to exectue predefined data manipulation operations when called.} 
\end{itemize}
