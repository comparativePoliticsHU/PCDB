\subsection{Configuration Year Duplicates}\label{view_configuration_year_duplicates}
View \texttt{\footnotesize view\_configuration\_year\_duplicates} is based on materialized view Configuration Events, which matches temporally corresponding configurations of cabinets, lower houses, upper houses, and presidencies.

It compiles primary configuration information (country identifier and configuration start and end dates) for the year of a configuration's start as well as for the year of its end, provided they are not identical. 

View \texttt{\footnotesize view\_configuration\_year\_duplicates} is programmed as follows: 

\lstinputlisting[%caption={Code to create year-duplicates of configurations.},
language=SQL]%
{../SQL-codes/view_configuration_year_duplicates.sql}

View \texttt{\footnotesize view\_configuration\_year\_duplicates} is essential to compute configruations' duration in a year (subsection \ref{view_configuration_duration_in_year}).
