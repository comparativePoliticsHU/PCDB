\subsection{Identify next institution-configurations within countries}\label{trg_prv_ids}
Another set of triggers (\texttt{\footnotesize trg\_*\_nxt\_id()}) is implemented on the base-tables Cabinet, Lower House, and on table Lower House Election, respectively, to assign the identifiers of the next instituion-configurations into cells of column \texttt{\footnotesize *\_prv\_id}.

Specifically, functions \texttt{\footnotesize trg\_*\_nxt\_id()} selects the identifier of the next  configuration, as identified by the next higher date of all the configurations recorded for a country within a table.
Schematically, it is programmed as follows:

\lstinputlisting[%caption={Example code to identify and select next identifier.},%
language=SQL]%
{../SQL-codes/trg_*_nxt_id_example.sql}

Where generally \texttt{\footnotesize *} refers to either \texttt{\footnotesize cab}, \texttt{\footnotesize lh}, or \texttt{\footnotesize lhelc}, and \texttt{\footnotesize *table} to either \texttt{\footnotesize cabinet}, \texttt{\footnotesize lower\_house}, or \texttt{\footnotesize lh\_election}.

Trigger \texttt{\footnotesize trg\_cab\_nxt\_id} is executed for each row before inserting or updating data to the base table.

{\bf Note}: In the case of table Lower House Election \texttt{\footnotesize \_sdate} is replaced by \texttt{\footnotesize \_date}, as it refers to election date instead of institution-configuration start date.

A detailed description of the respective triggers and functions is provided in the appendix (\ref{appendix_trigger_nxt_ids})
