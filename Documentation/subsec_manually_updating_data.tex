\subsection{Manually updating data}\label{subsec_manually_updating_data}

Altering the values of an existing row in a table is achieved with the \texttt{UPDATE}-operation, specifying the table and the column of the values that is thought to be updated.\footnote{\url{https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.3/static/dml-update.html}}
Updating is achieved by \texttt{SET}ting a column equal to some value that matcces the type of the respective column.
A \texttt{WHERE}-clause is requiered to identify the row(s) which you attempz to update. 

A minimum working example reads as follows:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=postgreSQL]
UPDATE config_data.cabinet 
	SET cab_sdate = '2017-06-15'::DATE 
	WHERE cab_id = 6038 
	AND ctr_id = 6 
	AND cab_sdate = '2017-01-01'::DATE;
\end{lstlisting}

Here, the value of the column that reports the cabinet's start date is updated in only one observation, as the attributes \texttt{cab\_id}, and \texttt{ctr\_id} and \texttt{ cab\_sdate}, respectively, uniquely identify rows in the cabinet table. (Note that using one identifier only would suffice.)

Note that it is possible to update information of more than one row. 
You could, for instance, 
\begin{lstlisting}[language=postgreSQL]
UPDATE config_data.cabinet 
	SET cab_hog_n = 'John Doe'::NAME 
	WHERE cab_hog_n = 'Licht'
	AND ctr_id = 6;
\end{lstlisting}
which would apply to all German cabinet configurations in which some guy with last name `Licht' was recorded as head of government (i.e., prime minister).

Note further that updating is proceeded row-by-row. Executing
\begin{lstlisting}[language=postgreSQL]
UPDATE config_data.cabinet 
	SET cab_id = cab_id+1
	WHERE ctr_id = 6;
\end{lstlisting}
would thus prompt an error, because increasing the first rows identifier by one would conflict with the \texttt{PRIMARY KEY}-constraint on the second rows \texttt{cab\_id}.\footnote{Becasue the second row might have \texttt{cab\_id = 6002}, increasing the first cabinet's identifier to \texttt{6002} violate the \texttt{UNIQUE}-constraint that is implicit to \texttt{PRIMARY KEY}.}
