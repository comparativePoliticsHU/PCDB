\subsection{Type B Volatility in Lower House Election Vote Shares}\label{subsec_view_lhelc_volb_vts}

View \texttt{view\_lhelc\_volb\_sts} is based on tables Lower Houses, Lower House Elections and Lower House Vote Results, and provides data at the level of lower house elections.

Type B volatility quantifies the change that occurs in the distribution of vote shares of parties in subsequent elections, comparing the results in the current election to that of the previous one.
Accordingly, type B volatility considers only so-called stable parties, and measures thevolatility in the distribution of votes arising from gains and losses of these stable partie.

The formula to compute \texttt{lhelc\_volb\_vts} is
\begin{equation}
\mbox{Seat\,B\,Volatility}(k) = \frac{ \bigg| \sum\limits_{j=1}^{Stable} v_{j,(k-1)} - v_{j,k}\bigg| }{2},
\end{equation}
where $v$ are vote shares that party $j$ gained in the current lower house $k$ or in the previous lower house $k-1$.

View \texttt{view\_lhelc\_volb\_vts} is defined as follows:
\lstinputlisting[%caption={Code to compute type B volatitlity ins lower house votes.},%
language=SQL]%
{../SQL-codes/views/view_lhelc_volb_vts.sql}

Stable parties are identified computationable by calculating the cross-product between rows in the subqueries 
\texttt{CUR\_LHELC} and \texttt{PREV\_LHELC}, and reporting only those for which a party identifier is enlisted in both the previous and the current election.

Note that the concept of stable party makes no sense for first recorded lower house elections, and hence B volatilities are not computed. 
The measure is highly sensitive to missing data, as no aggregate value is computed for lower house  elections in which at least one party except the group `Others withour seat' has NULL records for total vote results. 
A lack of reliable lower-level data thus causes missingness of aggregate data.

% Generally, consistency check \texttt{cc\_lhelc\_volb\_vts} [\ref{cc_lhelc_volb_vts}]) provides for a comparison of the computed and the recorded figures, though the recorded have been computed manually as well.
