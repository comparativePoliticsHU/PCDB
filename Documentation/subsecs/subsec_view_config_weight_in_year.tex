\subsection{Configuration Weight in Year}\label{view_config_weight_in_year}
View \texttt{\footnotesize view\_configuration\_weight\_in\_year} is based on view Configuration Year Duplicates (\ref{view_configuration_year_duplicates}) and provides information at the level of configuration-in-years.

It computes the temporal weights of a configuration in both the year of its start and the year of its end date, if not identical).  Weights are equal to the days of a configuration's duration in year relative to the days of duration of the year (regularly 365 days, except from leap years, and years of a country's first and last recorded configurations).

View \texttt{\footnotesize view\_configuration\_weight\_in\_year} is programmed as follows: 

\lstinputlisting[%caption={Code to compute the configuration temporal in-year weight.},
language=SQL]%
{../SQL-codes/view_config_weight_in_year.sql}

Temporal weights are essential to determine configurations relative dominance in a given year, for instance, when compiling a country-year dataset.
