\subsection{CC President candidates' electoral collage votes}\label{cc_pres_elec_collage_vts}
Consistency check \texttt{\footnotesize cc\_pres\_elec\_collage\_vts} is based on table Presidential Election Vote Results and provides information at the level of presidential election candidates. 

It enlists all candidates presidential election vote results for which electoral collage votes are recorded (variable \texttt{\footnotesize prselc\_vts\_clg} is \emph{not} \texttt{\footnotesize NULL}) but PCDB records indicate that no electoral collage should have been involved in the election of the president (variable \texttt{\footnotesize prselc\_clg} is \texttt{\footnotesize FALSE}). Thus one of both records is wrong.


CC \texttt{\footnotesize cc\_pres\_elec\_collage\_vts} is programmed as follow: 

\lstinputlisting[%caption={Code to create consistency check that enlists presidential election which are recorded as lacking an electoral college vote procedure but for which   such votes are recorded.},%
