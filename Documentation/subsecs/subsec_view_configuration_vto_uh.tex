\subsection{Upper House Veto Point}\label{view_configuration_vto_uh}

View \texttt{view\_configuration\_vto\_uh} is based on table Veto Points, Cabinet Portfolios and Upper House Seat Results, and materialized view Configuration Events, and provides information at the level of political configurations.
It computes whether the upper house constitutes an open veto point vis-\`{a}-vis the government in a given configuration, by comparing cabinet's seat share in the temproal corresponding upper house with the decisive counter-majority threshold recorded in table Veto Points. 

View \texttt{view\_configuration\_vto\_lh} is defined as follows:
\lstinputlisting[%caption={Code to determine if the upper house constitutes an open  veto point in a configuration.},%
language=SQL]%
{../SQL-codes/views/view_configuration_vto_uh.sql}


To guarantee that the computation of the upper houses veto points is sensitive to constitutional changes, joining political configurations with veto information is proceeded by start dates and country identifier. 
% Computation of the upper house's veto power in a given configuration is therefore up-to-date according to the inforamtion recorded in the Veto Points table.
Substracting the total seat share of cabinet parties in the upper house from the respective veto power threshold of upper houses results in a positive value when the former is smaller than the latter.
In this case, \texttt{vto\_pwr\_uh} assumes a value equal to one, indicating an open veto point.
