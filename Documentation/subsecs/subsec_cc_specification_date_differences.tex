\subsection{CC Institution start and election dates summary statistics}\label{cc_specification_date_differencese}
Consistency check \texttt{\footnotesize cc\_specification\_date\_differences} is based on CCs Cabinet Start Date, Lower House Start Date, Presidency Start Date, and Upper House Start Date, and provides
mean and median date difference, the number of differences unequal zero, and the total number of respective recorded configurations (\texttt{\footnotesize N}).

The difference between total and non-zero numbers of date differences hints to the number of principally suspect records (the higher, the more configurations where start dates are coded as equal to election date).

CC \texttt{\footnotesize cc\_specification\_date\_differences} is programmed as follows
