\subsection{Presidents' Veto}\label{view_configuration_vto_prs}
View \texttt{\footnotesize view\_configuration\_vto\_prs} is based on tables Presidential Elections, Cabinet Portfolios, Veto Points, and materialized view Configuration Events, and provides information at the level of political configurations.

It computes whether the president/Head of State (HoS) constitutes an open veto point vis-\`a-vis the government in a given configuration by checking for cohabitation and whether the constitution assigns veto power to the president.

To guarantee that the computation of the lower houses veto potential is sensitive to constitutional changes, joining poltitical configurations with veto inforamtion is proceeded by date and country. 
Computation of the HoS's veto power in a given configuration is therefore up-to-date according to the inforamtion recorded in the Veto Points table.


View \texttt{\footnotesize view\_configuration\_vto\_prs} is programmed as follows:
