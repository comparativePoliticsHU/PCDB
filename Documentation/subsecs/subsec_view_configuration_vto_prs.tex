\subsection{Presidential Veto Point}\label{view_configuration_vto_prs}
View \texttt{view\_configuration\_vto\_prs} is based on tables Presidential Elections, Cabinet Portfolios, Veto Points, and materialized view Configuration Events, and provides information at the level of political configurations.
It computes whether the president, that is, the Head of State (HoS) constitutes an open veto point vis-\`{a}-vis the government in a given configuration, by checking for cohabitation and whether the president is constitutionally entitled to veto national legislation. 

View \texttt{view\_configuration\_vto\_prs} is defined as follows:
\lstinputlisting[%caption={Code to determine if the president constitutes an open veto point in a configuration.},
language=SQL]%
{../SQL-codes/views/view_configuration_vto_prs.sql}

To guarantee that the computation of the presidents' veto potential is sensitive to constitutional changes, joining political configurations with veto information is proceeded by start dates and country identifier.
The resulting indicator is $1$, if the president was entitled to veto national legislation, and if he or she was in cohabitation (i.e., was affiliated with a party that was not in government) in a given political configuration.
%Computation of the HoS's veto power in a given configuration is therefore up-to-date according to the inforamtion recorded in the Veto Points table.
