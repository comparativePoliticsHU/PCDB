\subsection{Effective Number of Parties in Parliament, Maximum Fragmentation}\label{subsec_view_lh_enpp_maxfrag}

View \texttt{view\_lh\_enpp\_maxfrag} is based on tables Lower House Seat Results and Parties, and aggregtes data at the level of lower houses.

The effective number of parties in parliament (ENPP) is a measure of party system fractionalization that takes into acount the relative size of parties present in a country's lower house. 

Variable \texttt{lh\_enpp\_maxfrag} adjusts for the tendency of underestmating fractionalization of lower houses that implicite in \citeauthor{Laakso&Taagepera1979}'s original formular (Equ \ref{ENPP_equ_minfrag}). 

It applies what \citet[pp.\,600-602]{Gallagher&Mitchell2005} refer to as `Taagepera's least component approach': The seat share of the groups `Others with seats' (\texttt{otherw}) and `Indpendents' (\texttt{IND}) are split into $m$ fractions each, resulting in $m$ seat shares of size $s_{m}$. 

The fromula to compute \texttt{lh\_enpp\_maxfrag} is
\begin{equation}\label{ENPP_equ_maxfrag}
\mbox{ENPP}_{\mbox{\tiny maxfrag}}(k) = 1/\sum\limits_{j=1}^{J}m\left(\frac{s_{j,k}}{m}\right)^{2},
\end{equation} 
where $m$ is computed by dividing the number of seats of \texttt{otherw} or that of \texttt{IND}s by the number of seats of the smallest `real'\footnote{`Real' in the sense that the respective party is identified by a counter different from \#\#997 or \#\#998 (see \ref{subsec_tab_party}).} party in the respective lower house, and upround to the next bigger integer value, to guarantee that the seat share of  \texttt{otherw} and/or of \texttt{IND}s are smaller than that of the smallest `real' party. 
This adjustment equates to assuming maximum fragmentation.

View \texttt{view\_lh\_enpp\_maxfrag} is defined as follows:
\lstinputlisting[%caption={Code to compute the maximum-fragmentation Effective Number of Parties in Parliament.},%
language=SQL]%
{../SQL-codes/views/view_lh_enpp_maxfrag.sql}
Note that the ENPP is calculated with the computed, not the recorded total number of parties' seats in the lower house.
