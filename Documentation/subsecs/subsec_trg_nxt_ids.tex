\subsection{Identify next institution configurations within countries}\label{subsec_trg_prv_ids}

Another set of triggers (\texttt{trg\_*\_nxt\_id()}) is implemented on the basetables Cabinet, Lower House, and on table Lower House Election, respectively, to assign the identifiers of the next instituion configurations into cells of column \texttt{*\_prv\_id}.

Specifically, functions \texttt{trg\_*\_nxt\_id()} selects the identifier of the next  configuration, as identified by the next higher date of all the configurations recorded for a country within a table.
Schematically, it is defined as follows:
\lstinputlisting[%caption={Example code to identify and select next identifier.},%
language=postgreSQL]%
{../SQL-codes/triggers/trg_tab_nxt_id_example.sql}

Where the asterisk (\texttt{*}) replaces \texttt{cab}, \texttt{lh}, or \texttt{lhelc}, and \texttt{\#} to either \texttt{cabinet}, \texttt{lower\_house}, or \texttt{lh\_election}.

{\bf Note}: In the case of table Lower House Election \texttt{\_sdate} is replaced by \texttt{\_date}, as it refers to election date instead of institution-configuration start date.

A detailed description of the respective triggers and functions is provided in the Appendix (see \ref{subsec_appx_trg_nxt_ids}).
