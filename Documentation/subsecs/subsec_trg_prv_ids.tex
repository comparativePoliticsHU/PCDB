\subsection{Identify previous institution configurations within countries}\label{subsec_trg_prv_ids}

A set of triggers (\texttt{trg\_*\_prv\_id()}) is implemented on the base tables Cabinet, Lower House, Upper House, and Presidential Election, and on table Lower House Election, respectively, to assign the identifiers of previous institution configurations into cells of column \texttt{*\_prv\_id} (the asterisk replaces table names).

Specifically, functions \texttt{trg\_*\_prv\_id()} selects the identifier of the previous configuration, as identified by the next lower date of all the configurations recorded for a country within a base-table.
Schematically, it is defined as follows:
\lstinputlisting[%caption={Example code to identify and select previous identifier.},%
language=postgreSQL]%
{../SQL-codes/triggers/trg_tab_prv_id_example.sql}

Where the asterisk (\texttt{*}) replaces \texttt{cab}, \texttt{lh}, \texttt{lhelc}, \texttt{uh} or \texttt{prselc}, and \texttt{\#} to either \texttt{cabinet}, \texttt{lower\_house}, \texttt{lh\_election}, \texttt{upper\_house} or \texttt{presidential\_election}.

{\bf Note}: In the case of table Lower House Election \texttt{\_sdate} is replaced by \texttt{\_date}, as it refers to election date instead of institution configuration start date.

A detailed description of the respective triggers and functions is provided in the Appendix (see \ref{subsec_appx_trg_prv_ids}).
