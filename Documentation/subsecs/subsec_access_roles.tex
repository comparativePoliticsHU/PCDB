\subsection{Roles in the PCDB}\label{subsec_access_roles}
There exist three different roles with different sets of privileges to operate in the PCDB via \texttt{pgAdmin3}:
\begin{itemize}
\item[(1)]{{\bf Administrator}: Having all privileges on both the \texttt{public} and the \texttt{config\_data} schemes. 
This role is assumed by account \texttt{polconfdb} and \texttt{polconfdb\_1}. 
Having all privileges includes to \texttt{GRANT} and \texttt{REVOKE} privileges to and from other the user roles.}

\item[(2)]{{\bf Read-and-Write}: Having privileges  \texttt{SELCECT},  \texttt{INSERT}, and  \texttt{UPDATE} on both the \texttt{public} and the \texttt{config\_data} schemes. 
This role is assumed by account \texttt{polconfdb\_2} and \texttt{polconfdb\_3}.
Note that the  \texttt{SELECT}-privilege includes the operation  \texttt{COPY TO}, which allows to extract data from queries to  \texttt{.csv}-documents.}

\item[(3)]{{\bf Read-Only}: Having privilege \texttt{SELCECT} on both the \texttt{public} and the \texttt{config\_data} schemes. 
This role is assumed by account \texttt{polconfdb\_4} and \texttt{polconfdb\_5}.
The \texttt{SELECT}-privilege includes the operation  \texttt{COPY TO}.}
\end{itemize}

Definitions of the roles in the PCDB on the \texttt{CMS} server are provided in the Appendix (see \ref{subsec_appx_access_roles}).
