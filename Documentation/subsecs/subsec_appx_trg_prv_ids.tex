\subsection{Description of triggers to identify previous instituion configrations}\label{subsec_appx_trg_prv_ids}

\paragraph{Cabinet}\label{trg_cab_prv_id}
Trigger \texttt{trg\_cab\_prv\_id} is implemented on table Cabinet and inserts data into cells of column \texttt{cab\_prv\_id}. 

Specifically, function \texttt{trg\_cab\_prv\_id()} selects the identifier of the previous cabinet configuration, as identified by the next lower date of all cabinets recorded for a country.
It is defined as follows:

\lstinputlisting[%caption={Code to create trigger that identifies and inserts previous cabinet identifier.},%
language=SQL]%
{../SQL-codes/triggers/trg_cab_prv_id.sql}

Trigger \texttt{trg\_cab\_prv\_id} is executed for each row before inserting or updating of data in table Cabinet is performed. 

\paragraph{Lower House}\label{trg_lh_prv_id}
Trigger \texttt{trg\_lh\_prv\_id} is implemented on table Lower House and inserts data into cells of column \texttt{lh\_prv\_id}. 
Specifically, function \texttt{trg\_lh\_prv\_id()} selects the identifier of the previous recorded lower house, as identified by the next lower date of all lower houses recorded for a country.
It is defined as follows:
\lstinputlisting[%caption={Code to create trigger that identifies and inserts previous lower house identifier.},%
language=SQL]%
{../SQL-codes/triggers/trg_lh_prv_id.sql}

Trigger \texttt{trg\_lh\_prv\_id} is executed for each row before inserting or updating of data in table Lower House is performed. 


\paragraph{LH Election}\label{trg_lhelc_prv_id}
Trigger \texttt{trg\_lhelc\_prv\_id} is implemented on table LH Election and inserts data into cells of column \texttt{lhelc\_prv\_id}. 
Specifically, function \texttt{trg\_lhelc\_prv\_id()} selects the identifier of the previous lower house election, as identified by the next lower date of all recorded lower houses election dates for a country.
It is defined as follows:
\lstinputlisting[%caption={Code to create trigger that identifies and inserts previous lower house election identifier.},%
language=SQL]%
{../SQL-codes/triggers/trg_lhelc_prv_id.sql}

Trigger \texttt{trg\_lhelc\_prv\_id} is executed for each row before inserting or updating of data in table Lower House Election is performed.  

\paragraph{Upper House}\label{trg_uh_prv_id}
Trigger \texttt{trg\_uh\_prv\_id} is implemented on table Upper House and inserts data into cells of column \texttt{uh\_prv\_id}. 
Specifically, function \texttt{trg\_uh\_prv\_id()}  selects the identifier of the previous recorded upper house configuration, as identified by the next lower date of all upper houses recorded for a country.
It is defined as follows:
\lstinputlisting[%caption={Code to create trigger that identifies and inserts previous upper house identifier.},%
language=SQL]%
{../SQL-codes/triggers/trg_uh_prv_id.sql}

Trigger \texttt{trg\_uh\_prv\_id} is executed for each row before inserting or updating of data in table Upper House is performed.

\paragraph{Presidential Election}\label{trg_prselc_prv_id}
Trigger \texttt{trg\_prselc\_prv\_id} is implemented on table Presidential Election and inserts data into cells of column \texttt{prselc\_prv\_id}. 
Specifically, function \texttt{trg\_prselc\_prv\_id()} selects the identifier of the previous presidential election, as identified by the next lower date of all presidential elections recorded for a country.
It is defined as follows:
\lstinputlisting[%caption={Code to create trigger that identifies and inserts idetnifier of previous presidential election.},%
language=SQL]%
{../SQL-codes/triggers/trg_prselc_prv_id.sql}

Trigger \texttt{trg\_prselc\_prv\_id} is executed for each row before inserting or updating of data in table Presidential Election is performed.
