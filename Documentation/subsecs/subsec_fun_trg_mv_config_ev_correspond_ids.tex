\subsection{Insert corresponding insitution identifiers}\label{subsec_fun_trg_mv_config_ev_correspond_ids}

Function \texttt{trg\_mv\_config\_ev\_correspond\_ids()} is defined on table Configuration Events Materialized View in order to insert the identifiers of the then active institutional configuration into empty cells.
To do so, it chooses the identifier value of the institutional configuration that became active most recently. 
It is triggered by insert, update, or delete from the Configuration Events Materialized View (see \ref{subsec_trg_mv_config_ev_correspond_ids}).

Technically, this equates to select the value of row with the next smallest start date where the identifier is not null
Schematically, the functions and triggers are defined as follows
\lstinputlisting[%caption={Code to create triggers that identify and insert corresponding  identifier in configuarations.},%
language=postgreSQL,commentstyle=\color{white}]%
{../SQL-codes/triggers/trg_mv_config_ev_correspond_ids_example.sql}
Where the asterisk (\texttt{*}) replaces \texttt{cab}, \texttt{lh}, \texttt{lhelc}, \texttt{uh} or \texttt{prselc}.
A detailed definition of the single functions and triggers is provided in the Appendix (see \ref{subsec_appx_fun_trg_mv_config_ev_correspond_ids}).
