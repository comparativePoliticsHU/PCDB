\subsection{Materialized View Configuration Events trigger structure}\label{subsec_trigger_structure_mv_config_ev}


A Change on the base tables Cabinet, Lower House, Upper House, Presidential Elections, and Veto Points triggers a refresh of affected rows in the Configuration Events Materialised View:
\begin{itemize}

\item[-]{On update of columns having the institutional configuration identifier or start date values listed in the materialized view, function \texttt{mv\_config\_ev\_*\_ut()} is called, where the asterisk \texttt{*} is a placeholder for the table name.
This function will perform one call of function \texttt{mv\_config\_ev\_refresh\_row()} with old country identifier and start date values (note that start date refers to the configuration start date at the level of the base table, e.g. \texttt{cab\_sdate} or \texttt{prs\_sdate}), and another call with new (i.e., updated) country identifier and configuration start date values for each row that is updated.}

\item[-]{On insert into a base table function \texttt{mv\_config\_ev\_*\_it()} is called, which performs a call of \texttt{mv\_config\_ev\_refresh\_row()} with newly inserted country identifier and configuration start date values for each row that is inserted.}

\item[-]{On delete from a base table call function \texttt{mv\_config\_ev\_*\_dt()} is calles, which performs a call of \texttt{mv\_config\_ev\_refresh\_row()} with the country identifier and start date values of the row that is removed for each row that is deleted.}
\end{itemize}

These event triggers are defined on each of the base tables and named \texttt{mv\_config\_ev\_update}, \texttt{mv\_config\_ev\_insert}, and \texttt{mv\_config\_ev\_delete}, respectively. 

\subsubsection{Function \texttt{mv\_config\_ev\_refresh\_row()}}

Function \texttt{mv\_config\_ev\_refresh\_row()} performs a refresh of rows in materialized view Configuration Events for a given combination of country identifier and start date
% 
% 
% Rows in mv_configuration_events are uniquely identified by primary key (ctr_id, sdate).
% Data in mv_configuration_events comes from tables that are mentioned in the underly the definition of view_configuration events (i.e., tables Cabinet, Lower House, Upper House, Presidential Election, and Veto Points)-
% 
% In order to execute a refresh of rows of mv_configuration_events (triggered by insert/delete/update actions on base tables), 
% 	(i) all triggers on MV are disabled, 
% 	(ii) row identified by ctr_id and sdate (defined as arguments to function) is deletedfrom MV,
% 	(iii) row identified by ctr_id and sdate (defined as arguments to function) is inserted to MV from underlying view view_configuration_events,
% 	(iv) all triggers on MV are enabled, 
% 	(v) columns containing corresponding IDs of institions in mv_configuration_events are updated in order to trigger trg_mv_config_ev_correspond_ids, and
% 	(vi) column containing end date of given configuration is updated where date is younger then recently refreshed row (for odler start and end dates will not be affected by refresh) 
%   
It executes the following actions:
\begin{itemize}
\item[(i)]{It disables all triggers implemented on materialized view Configuration Events;}
\item[(ii)]{deletes the row from materialized view Configuration Events that is identified by input arguments country identifier and start date (\texttt{ctr\_id} and \texttt{sdate});}
\item[(iii)]{inserts the respective configuration information (country identifier and start date) from {\em view} Configuration Events into {\em materialized view} Configuration Events;}
\item[(iv)]{enables all triggers implemented on materialized view Configuration Events;}
\item[(v)]{updates all columns containing the affected institution identifiers in order to trigger \texttt{trg\_mv\_config\_ev\_correspond\_ids}; and}
\item[(vi)]{updates column containing configuration end dates (\texttt{edate}) of the configurations of the same country that have a younger start date younger than the currently refreshed row (for odler start and end dates will not be affected by refresh).}
\end{itemize}

The function is defined as follows:

language=postgreSQL]%
{../SQL-codes/fun_mv_config_ev_refresh_row.sql}

\subsubsection{Triggers \texttt{mv\_config\_ev\_*\_id\_*\_trg}}

Because \texttt{mv\_config\_ev\_refresh\_row()} only affects rows in materialised view Configuration Events identified by input arguments country identifier and start date, not all rows in which an institution-configuration ID is listed will be affected (recall that one institutional configuration may correspond to multiple configuration events).
Hence, a change in a base table that affects the configuration identifier of this institutional configuration requires to propagate this change through all configuration events in the materialized vies that are associated with this identifier. 

This is achieved by a set of triggers named \texttt{mv\_config\_ev\_*\_id\_*\_trg}, where the first asterisk is a placeholder for the institutions (i.e., is \texttt{cab}, \texttt{lh}, \texttt{uh}, \texttt{lhelc}, or \texttt{prselc}), and the second asterisk is a placeholder for trigger events update (\texttt{ut}), insert (\texttt{it}), or delete (\texttt{dt}):
\begin{itemize}
\item[-]Trigger \texttt{mv\_config\_ev\_*\_id\_ut\_trg} calls function \texttt{mv\_config\_ev\_*\_id\_ut\_trg()} on update of the identifier column, which performs function \texttt{mv\_config\_ev\_ut\_*\_id()} with the two input arguments old and new identifier.
\texttt{mv\_config\_ev\_ut\_*\_id()} updates materialized view Configuration Events and sets all identifier values to the new identifier value where they are currently equal to the old identifier value.

\item[-]Trigger \texttt{mv\_config\_ev\_*\_id\_it\_trg} calls function \texttt{mv\_config\_ev\_*\_id\_it\_trg()}, which executes an update of materialized view Configuration Events, setting the respective identifier column equal to its actually values, which will trigger the inserting of corresponding IDs (implemented by yet another trigger defined on materialised view configuration events)

\item[-]Trigger \texttt{mv\_config\_ev\_*\_id\_dt\_trg} calls function \texttt{mv\_config\_ev\_*\_id\_dt\_trg()} on delete of a row in the respective base table, which performs function \texttt{mv\_config\_ev\_dt\_*\_id()} with the old (i.e., to-be-removed) identifier value as single input argument.
\texttt{mv\_config\_ev\_dt\_*\_id()} updates materialized view Configuration Events and sets all identifier values to \texttt{NULL} where they are equal to the old identifier value.
\end{itemize}
