It is programmed as follows:

\lstinputlisting[%caption={Code to create trigger that identifies and inserts next lower house identifier.},%
language=SQL]%
{../SQL-codes/trg_lh_nxt_id.sql}

Trigger \texttt{\footnotesize trg\_lh\_nxt\_id} is executed for each row before inserting or updating  data of table Lower House.
