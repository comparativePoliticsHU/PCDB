\subsection{CC Cabinet Head of Government}\label{cc_cabinet_hog_info}
Consistency check \texttt{\footnotesize cc\_cabinet\_hog\_info} is based on the Cabinet Portfolios table and provides information at the level of cabinet configurations.

It enlists all cabinet configurations for which more than one party is recorded as producing the Head of Government (HOG) (variable \texttt{\footnotesize pty\_cab\_hog}).

The view is programmed as follows:

\lstinputlisting[%caption={Code to create consistency check that enlists all cabinets for which more/less than one head of government is recorded.},%
language=SQL]%
{../SQL-codes/cc_cabinet_hog_info.sql}

It groups rows in cabinet portfolios (i.e., parties) by \texttt{\footnotesize cab\_id}, the identifier of cabinet configurations (equivalent to unique combinations of country and cabinet start date), and counts parties within a cabinet  which are recorded to produce the HOG. 
If this count is \emph{not} equal to one, this indicates an inconsistency in the data, because logically only one party can produce the HOG.
Accordingly, no cabinet configuration should be enlisted in this CC.
