\subsection{Territorial Veto Point}\label{view_configuration_vto_terr}

View \texttt{view\_configuraion\_vto\_terr} is based on table Veto Points and materialized view Configuration Events, and provides information at the level of political configurations.
It computes whether territorial units constitute an open veto point vis-\`{a}-vis the government in a given configuration.

View \texttt{view\_configuraion\_vto\_terr} is defined as follows:
\lstinputlisting[%caption={Code to determine if territorial units constitute an open  veto point in a configuration.},%
language=SQL]%
{../SQL-codes/views/view_configuration_vto_terr.sql}

Because veto power of territorial units is contingent on constitutional provisions,
joining political configurations with veto information is proceeded by start dates and country identifier. 
%Computation of the territrial units' veto power in a given configuration is therefore up-to-date according to the inforamtion recorded in the Veto Points table.
