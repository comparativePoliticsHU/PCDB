\subsubsection{Computing configurations end dates}\label{subsubsec_trg_mv_config_ev_edate}
Configuration end dates are computed and inserted into cells of column \texttt{edate} by triggers \texttt{trg\_*\_mv\_config\_ev\_edate}, which calls function \texttt{trg\_mv\_config\_ev\_edate()}.
The function selects the start date of the next recorded political configuration, as identified by the next bigger date of all recorded political configurations for a country, substracts one day from this date and assigns the resulting date as end date of the respective configuration:

{../SQL-codes/trg_mv_config_ev_edate.sql}

Trigger \texttt{trg\_it\_mv\_config\_ev\_edate} is executed for each row of materialized view Configuration Events after inserting new data, i.e., whenever a new configuration emerges; function  
\texttt{trg\_dt\_mv\_config\_ev\_edate} is executed for each row of materialzied view Configuration Events after deleting data from it; and 
function \texttt{trg\_ut\_mv\_config\_ev\_edate}, in turn, is executed for each row of materialzied view Configuration Events before its data is updated.  

{\bf Note}: The events insert, update or delete occur whenever data in the tables that underly view Configuration Events (and accordingly its materilization) is changed, that is, data is inserted to, updated in or deleted from tables Cabinet, Lower House, Upper House, or Presidential Elections. 

The trigger structure that executes function \texttt{trg\_mv\_config\_ev\_edate()} is constituted on a chain of trigger functions, which {\em in toto} guarantee for the consistency and actuallity of the data that informs about countries' history of political configurations.
