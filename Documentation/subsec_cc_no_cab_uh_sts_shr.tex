\subsection{CC Cabinet's Upper House seat share}\label{cc_no_cab_uh_sts_shr}
Consistency check \texttt{\footnotesize cc\_no\_cab\_uh\_sts\_shr} is based on views Cabinet's Upper House Seat Share and Configuration Events, and provides information at the level of political configurations. 

It enlists all political configurations for which cabinet parties total seat share in the corresponding upper house (UH) cannot be computed (i.e., \texttt{\footnotesize Null}-value displayed).
\texttt{\footnotesize Null}-values possibly stem from missing UH election seat result records (see CC \texttt{\footnotesize cc\_missing\_uh\_pty\_sts\_records}, subsection \ref{missing_uh_sts_records}), or configurations in which the given cabinet party identifiers do not match party identifiers in the corresponding UH.

CC \texttt{\footnotesize cc\_no\_cab\_uh\_sts\_shr} is programmed as follow:

{\em {\bf Note}}: For Germany (country identifier = 6) generally no seat share of cabinet parties in the UH can be computed. Consider manual computation!
