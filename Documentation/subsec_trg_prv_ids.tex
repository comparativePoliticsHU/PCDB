\subsection{Identify previous institution-configurations within countries}\label{trg_prv_ids}
A set of triggers (\texttt{\footnotesize trg\_*\_prv\_id()}) is implemented on the base-tables Cabinet, Lower House, Upper House, and Presidential Election, and on table Lower House Election, respectively, to assign the identifiers of previous instituion-configurations into cells of column \texttt{\footnotesize *\_prv\_id}.

Specifically, functions \texttt{\footnotesize trg\_*\_prv\_id()} selects the identifier of the previous  configuration, as identified by the next lower date of all the configurations recorded for a country within a base-table.
Schematically, it is programmed as follows:
% 
% \lstinputlisting[%caption={Example code to identify and select previous identifier.},%
% language=SQL]%
% {../SQL-codes/trg_*_prv_id_example.sql}

Where generally \texttt{\footnotesize *} refers to either \texttt{\footnotesize cab}, \texttt{\footnotesize lh}, \texttt{\footnotesize lhelc}, \texttt{\footnotesize uh} or \texttt{\footnotesize prselc}, and \texttt{\footnotesize *table} to either \texttt{\footnotesize cabinet}, \texttt{\footnotesize lower\_house}, \texttt{\footnotesize lh\_election}, \texttt{\footnotesize upper\_house} or \texttt{\footnotesize presidential\_election}.

Trigger \texttt{\footnotesize trg\_cab\_nxt\_id} is executed for each row before inserting or updating data to the base table.

{\bf Note}: In the case of table Lower House Election \texttt{\footnotesize \_sdate} is replaced by \texttt{\footnotesize \_date}, as it refers to election date instead of institution-configuration start date.

A detailed description of the respective triggers and functions is provided in the appendix (\ref{appendix_trigger_prv_ids})
