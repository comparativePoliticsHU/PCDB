It computes the joint seat share of cabinet parties in the corresponding upper house (UH).

\begin{itemize}
\item[-]no upper house configuration correspoonds the given cabinet or vice-versa; or
\item[-]cabinet parties cannot be identified in table Upper House Seat Results (i.e., mismatch of \texttt{\footnotesize pty\_id}s).
\end{itemize}
