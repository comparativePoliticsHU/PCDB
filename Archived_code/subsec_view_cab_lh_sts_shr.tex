\subsection{Cabinet's Seat Share in the Lower House}\label{view_cab_lh_sts_shr}
View \texttt{\footnotesize view\_cab\_lh\_sts\_shr} is based on tables Cabinet Portfolios and Lower House, and views Configuration Events (\ref{view_configuration_events}) and Party's Seat Share in the Lower House (\ref{view_pty_lhelc_sts_shr}), and provides information at the level of political configurations. 

It computes the joint seat share of cabinet parties in the corresponding lower house (LH).

View \texttt{\footnotesize view\_cab\_lh\_sts\_shr} is programmed as follows:


\lstinputlisting[%caption={Code to compute cabinet parties' seat share in the lower house.},
language=SQL]%
{../SQL-codes/view_cab_lh_sts_shr.sql}

Varaible \texttt{\footnotesize cab\_lh\_sts\_shr} is a column in the Configuration view and essential to determine whether the LH constitutes an open veto point vis-Ã -vis the government in a given political configuration.

\texttt{\footnotesize NULL}-values might stem from different missings, such as 
\begin{itemize}
\item[-]no lower house configuration correspoonds the given cabinet or vice-versa;
\item[-]no \texttt{\footnotesize lhelc\_id} listed in table Lower House that would allow to compute joint seat share (check using \texttt{\footnotesize cc\_no\_lhelc\_id\_4\_lh}, subsection \ref{cc_no_lhelc_id_4_lh});
\item[-]no seats recorded for cabinet parties in table Lower House Seat Results (check using \texttt{\footnotesize cc\_missing\_lhelc\_pty\_sts\_records}, subsection \ref{cc_missing_lhelc_pty_sts_records}); or
\item[-]cabinet parties cannot be identified in table Lower House Seat Results (i.e., mismatch of \texttt{\footnotesize pty\_id}s).
\end{itemize}
