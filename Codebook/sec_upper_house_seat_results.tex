\section{Upper House Seat Results}\label{sec_upper_house_seat_results}
This table compiles data on the seat composition in upper houses at the party-level. 
Rows are the parties (identified by variable \texttt{\footnotesize pty\_id}) and their respective seat results in a given upper house (variable \texttt{\footnotesize uh\_id}).

Information is obtained from \citeauthor{Nohlen2001} (\citeyear{Nohlen2001}, \citeyear{Nohlen2005}, \citeyear{Nohlen2010}), and was complemented by individual-case research. 
Weblinks to, or citations of individual sources are provided either in \texttt{\footnotesize uhsres\_src}, or the general source information on the correponding upper house election (\texttt{\footnotesize uhelc\_src} in Table \ref{tab_uh_election}).

%The table contains the following variables:
