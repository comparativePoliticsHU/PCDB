\section{Lower House Election Party Results}\label{sec_lh_election_party_results}
This view compiles data on parties' vote and seat results in lower house elections.

Note that seat and vote shares are calculated using the computed, not the recorded number of total seats or votes in the lower house (see Section \ref{Section_View_Lower_House} for comments on the difference between both).
