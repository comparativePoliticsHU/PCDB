\section{Cabinet Portfolios}\label{sec_cabinet_portfolios}
This table provides information on cabinet portfolios. 

As cabinet portfolio we define the composition of a cabinet at the party-level.
%, i.e., the parties that form the, government, the number of a partyâ€™s share on total cabinet seats, and parties supporting government. 
Thus, new portfolios are included whenever a new cabinet emerges.
The changes that occur at the party-level regularly correspond to the events enumerated as criteria for recording a new cabinet configuration (cf. Section \ref{sec_cabinet}):
\begin{itemize}%\itemsep-4pt \parsep0pt
\item[a)] Coalition composition changes.
\item[b)] Head of government changes.
\item[c)] Government formation after general legislative elections (not in presidential systems).
\end{itemize}
Obviously, combinations of cabinet and party identifier are unique in the cabinet portfolios table.

Information is obtained from \citet*{Woldendrop_et_al2000} and the Political Data Yearbook \citeyearpar{EJPR_PDY}, and was complemented by individual-case research.
