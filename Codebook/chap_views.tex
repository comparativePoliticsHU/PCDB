\chapter{Views}\label{chap_views}

\subparagraph{Technical note}
Views are virtual tables based on the result-set of queries executed on tables.
That is, a view contains rows and columns, just like a real table. 
However, the fields in a view regularly compile (i.e., `join') information from more than one real table in the database.

It is a specific property of views that they are not physically materialized. Instead, the query is run every time the view is selected or referenced in another query.

Whenever you obtain information from a view, it is certain that all provided information is up-to-date.
